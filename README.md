### **Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.**

Many websites offer ways to download 3D printable files, but these websites have an issue in certain ways. Thingyverse.com helps people to search and import free files. That's fantastic. But there's a problem. Our rival has turned into a repository for replica items to be uploaded, or snatched and re-purposed as someone else's. Print it is attempting to address this issue by being a'middle exchange control framework.' We allow users to upload highly designed and specialised items while also giving them the protection to exchange files for profit.

### **Why is it a problem that needs solving?**

3D printing enthusiasts and working professionals devote so much effort to perfecting and crafting their creations that it becomes an embarrassment and a great burden for the artist not to generate money for sharing their gifts with the world. Before it was printed, artists had to accept no recompense for their works, or even hope that customers would donate to Thingyverse account, which rarely happens. Print it allows the user total freedom, allowing them to build their own rules for how and for how long they want to market their 3D printable marvels. Print it also contains backup logs of the files purchased in case you forget the purchased files or they get corrupt, which distinguishes us from out competitors.
