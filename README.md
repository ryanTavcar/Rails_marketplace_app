### **Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.**

Print it strives to be a platform that draws consumers due to its middle management feature, which enables customers to safely exchange files for payment between them. Print also enables users to create a log of their own 3D printable products that they have accumulated, products that they have purchased and products that they have appreciated. This gives users trust that if they lose the files they've bought, re-downloading those files is never a concern they need to have.
